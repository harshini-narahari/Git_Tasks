Main Task
----------

git status              # also tells on which branch you are

git branch  b1          # used to create a branch 

git checkout b1         #used to switch to the created branch named b1

git log                 # shows commits history

git checkout master      #to move back to master (i.e main)

git checkout b1          #move back to created branch

gitk --all               #gitk used to visualize the commit history

#merge your created branch to the master
git checkout master      
git merge b1            #git merge command used to merge your branch into the master branch
git log                 #show that only the new changes as previous are already merged
#This merge commit reflects the point at which your branch was combined with the master branch.

gitk --all              #shows Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of your repository and the things are forked
git log


Stretch Task
-------------

git checkout b1

#make some commits
nano a.txt
git add a.txt
git commit -m "First commit on branch"

nano b.txt
git add b.txt
git commit -m "Second commit on branch"

git checkout master        #return to master

nano a.txt               #adding content (making modifications)

git add a.txt
git commit -m "Changes commit on master"

git merge b1            #again merging branch b1 to master  --> results in a conflict 

check for conflicts and resolve them. After resolving all conflicts , use git add command to add that file.

git add a.txt

git commit -m "Merge commit after resolving conflicts"

gitk --all          #visualize that DAG
